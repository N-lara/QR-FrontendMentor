## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

This was a fiarly simple task but a fun learning experience. this was my first time using SCSS to compile CSS for styling a page. SCSS was a interesting and intuitive language, and I plan on continuing to practice this method.

### Useful resources

- [freecodecamp youtube video about SCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&t=1791) - This video really helped me understand SCSS and how it works if you want to see examples and good explinations this is a great resource.
- [sass documentation website](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - this is the official documentation for scss it has some good examples and explains well how this language can be used.
